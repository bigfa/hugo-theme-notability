&lt;p>Over the weekend, I had a meal at Garden Pavilion, located at the Park Hyatt hotel. Prior to this visit, I was hesitant due to the high average cost per person mentioned on Dianping, ranging from seven to eight hundred yuan. However, since we were staying at the hotel, we decided to give it a try. In all honesty, the overall experience was underwhelming. The atmosphere was pleasant, but the dishes were quite mediocre, and the prices were steep. I would say it was not worth the expense.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Park Hyatt ShenZhen</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/park-hyatt-shenzhen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 19:07:06 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/park-hyatt-shenzhen/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Since successfully completing the Globalist challenge, I have gradually started experiencing Hyatt hotels. In Shenzhen, I only wanted to experience Andaz and Park Hyatt. Last Saturday, I stayed at Park Hyatt Shenzhen. I opted for a cash stay this time, and the price of 2100 RMB on a Saturday was considered reasonable, considering that hotel prices in Shenzhen tend to be higher on weekends.&lt;/p>
