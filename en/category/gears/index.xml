I am writing an article to wrap up my experiences, all of which are based on my actual usage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First of all, &lt;strong>the selection of equipment is a very important part of the enjoyment of photography&lt;/strong>. You may quickly lose interest after the purchase, but it&amp;rsquo;s undeniable that the selection process is extremely joyful. Personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t use a camera bag, rarely use a tripod or flash, mainly do city walks, and one-fourth of the time, I take portraits of my wife. I&amp;rsquo;ve shot over 60,000 shutters on two Fuji cameras. I use the XT-5 approximately half of the time because it has skin beautifying features which I prefer a bit more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF23mm F1.4 R LM WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/xf23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 12:46:11 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/xf23/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>35 equivalent lenses, they are just never wide enough or never tight enough, like story of my life.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now whenever I use a 35mm lens, I have this image in my mind, with a strange sense of sadness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Years ago, when I was using Olympus, I bought a prime lens that was roughly equivalent to 35mm. I didn’t choose this focal length because I particularly liked it, but simply because it was affordable. Later, I used the X100V, buying a camera with a fixed lens just to save money. Now, after nearly two years of using the X100V, I haven’t even taken ten thousand photos, which shows that I am not quite comfortable with this focal length.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Leica Sofort</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/sofort/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 09:32:23 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/sofort/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first instant camera I owned was the Fuji Mini 40. I used it for about a year and a half and took around 400 pictures with it. Because I wanted to try double exposure, I decided to upgrade to the Mini 90. However, I found out that its price has risen to 1500 dollars. Coincidentally, Leica recently released the Sofort 2, which reminded me of the Sofort 1 that I couldn’t afford years ago.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF33mm F1.4 R LM WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/xf33/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:55:59 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/xf33/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The XF33mmF1.4 lens is currently one of the most difficult lenses to buy in mainland China. It is basically out of stock everywhere online, and even pre-orders come with a price markup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I originally planned to publish this article at least during the Singles’ Day shopping festival, but unexpectedly, it was published much earlier. The main reason is that this lens is simply unavailable, and it’s impossible to buy, even with pre-orders requiring a price markup. A while ago, I sold two lens adapters on a second-hand marketplace. Occasionally, I would check the marketplace, and I happened to come across a seller in Beijing offering this lens, which they purchased during the June 18th shopping festival. They even registered it for extended warranty. After a brief conversation, I decided to buy it. If it weren’t for finding this seller, I almost bought a brand new 35mm f1.4 lens, but this lens is old, dating back 10 years, and even the most bizarre coincidences couldn’t keep it going.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF56mm F1.2 R WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/xf56/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:59:07 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/xf56/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, I bought a lens mainly because the low-light performance of my X100V was poor. When I pick up the camera at night and want to quickly take a photo, it’s highly likely to come out blurry or have a lot of noise if I increase the ISO. When I didn’t know much about Fujifilm lenses, my first choice was the XF50F1.0 because of its large aperture. Although it costs over 10,000, it’s still relatively affordable compared to full-frame lenses. However, after doing more research, I realized that this lens is bulky and weighs almost two kilograms, which is not suitable for Fujifilm’s compact bodies. Additionally, I have a limited budget and can’t afford a brand new lens.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF18mm F1.4 R LM WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/xf18/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 09:34:23 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/xf18/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Actually, I received this lens before the XF56 Mark II, but I didn’t use it much and didn’t take many sample photos. I always felt that this lens had greater potential, so I took it out last weekend and took some shots. However, I realized that it was just the same as before, and I ended up with only a few photos for this article.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF 90mm f/2 R LM WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/xf90/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 14:22:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/hugo-theme-puma/en/story/xf90/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Fuji has a relatively niche lens, and it’s also quite old. The second-hand price is around 4000, but usually, it has been used for a long time. The original price is too expensive, so I ended up finding a refurbished one through official channels. It has a minor defect with a small dust particle, but it’s tolerable. When I purchased the XF 56, I mentioned that the focal length was not quite enough. At that time, I seriously considered the XF 50-140. Although it has received almost 100% positive reviews, I eventually decided against it due to its high price and weight. The main reason behind this decision was certainly the price, as it was simply too expensive.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
